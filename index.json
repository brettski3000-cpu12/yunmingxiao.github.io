Typically, the clustering mutants on networks can dramatically alter the direction of selection. Previous studies on the assortment of mutants assume that individuals interact in a frequency-dependent way. It is hard to tell how assortment alone alters the evolutionary fate. We establish a minimal network model to disentangle the assortment from the game interaction. We find that for weak selection limit, the assortment of mutants plays little role in fixation probability. For strong selection limit, connected mutants, i.e., the maximum assortment, are best for fixation. When the mutants are separated by only one wild-type individual, it is worse off than that separated by more than one wild-type individual in fixation probability. Our results show the nontrivial yet fundamental effect of the clustering on fixation. Noteworthily, it has already arisen, even if the game interaction is absent.","tags":["Evolutionary Game Theory","Population Dynamics"],"title":"Close spatial arrangement of mutants favors and disfavors fixation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Aritra Dutta","El Houcine Bourger","Yunming Xiao","Marco Canini","Peter Richtarik"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1559034753,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1559034753,"objectID":"eebe9374e6d98e2ae6d85a7b235d7d1a","permalink":"https://yunmingxiao.github.io/publication/dna/","publishdate":"2019-05-28T09:12:33Z","relpermalink":"/publication/dna/","section":"publication","summary":"Optimization acceleration techniques such as momentum play a key role in state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms. Recently, generic vector sequence extrapolation techniques, such as regularized nonlinear acceleration (RNA) of Scieur et al., were proposed and shown to accelerate fixed point iterations. In contrast to RNA which computes extrapolation coefficients by (approximately) setting the gradient of the objective function to zero at the extrapolated point, we propose a more direct approach, which we call direct nonlinear acceleration (DNA). In DNA, we aim to minimize (an approximation of) the function value at the extrapolated point instead. We adopt a regularized approach with regularizers designed to prevent the model from entering a region in which the functional approximation is less precise. While the computational cost of DNA is comparable to that of RNA, our direct approach significantly outperforms RNA on both synthetic and real-world datasets. While the focus of this paper is on convex problems, we obtain very encouraging results in accelerating the training of neural networks.","tags":["Machine Learning"],"title":"Direct Nonlinear Acceleration","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yunming Xiao","Haifeng Sun","Zirui Zhuang","Jingyu Wang","Qi Qi"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1538352000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1538352000,"objectID":"977d5576653c418e2c0f21d510bad40d","permalink":"https://yunmingxiao.github.io/publication/lcn/","publishdate":"2019-02-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/lcn/","section":"publication","summary":"Deep neural networks have been used for traffic classification, and promising results are obtained. However, most previous work confined to one specific classification task and restricted the classifiers potential performance and applications. As the traffic flows can be labeled from different perspectives, the performance of the classifier might be improved by exploring more meaningful latent features. For this purpose, we adopted a multi-output DNN model that simultaneously learns different traffic classification tasks. The common knowledge of traffic is exploited by the synergy among the tasks and boosts the individual performances of the tasks. Experiments show that this structure has the potential to meet new future demands and achieve the classification with advanced speeds and fair accuracies. Yet, due to the heavy training cost, the neural networks, though achieving good performance, are hard to implement in the real environment. We further show that few-shot learning could be a viable approach.","tags":["Traffic Classification","Machine Learning"],"title":"Common Knowledge Based Transfer Learning for Traffic Classification","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"fd36605688ef45e10dc233c860158012","permalink":"https://yunmingxiao.github.io/cv/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/cv/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"3ef1c3ed755398dc4fffccfec12a9a68","permalink":"https://yunmingxiao.github.io/misc/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/misc/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"6087c0ef875554f4409ac52928d79279","permalink":"https://yunmingxiao.github.io/projects/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/projects/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"widget_page"}]
